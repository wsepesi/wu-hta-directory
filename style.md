# Minimalist Typography-Focused Style Guide

## Overall Design Philosophy
Clean, minimalist design with a focus on typography and whitespace. The aesthetic is sophisticated, understated, and timeless. The design prioritizes readability and content hierarchy over decorative elements.

## Layout & Structure

### Grid System
- Centered content layout with generous horizontal margins
- Single-column layout for main content areas
- Navigation spans full width at top of page

### Spacing
- Very generous vertical whitespace between sections
- Clean line spacing for text blocks
- Ample padding around all content areas

## Typography

### Primary Heading Font
- Script/handwritten style font for main brand/title
- Elegant, flowing calligraphy style
- Large size (approximately 72-96px)
- Dark charcoal/black color
- Centered alignment

### Body Text Font
- Clean, classic serif font (similar to Times New Roman or Minion Pro)
- Medium weight for readability
- Dark charcoal color (#333 or similar)
- Line height approximately 1.4-1.6

### Navigation Font
- Same serif font as body text
- All caps formatting
- Slightly smaller than body text
- Letter spacing increased for readability
- Medium font weight

### Content Hierarchy
- **Section headers**: Bold serif, slightly larger than body text
- **Metadata**: Clean formatting, right-aligned or inline
- **Emphasized text**: Regular weight, sometimes italicized for emphasis
- **Descriptions**: Regular serif, comfortable reading size

## Color Palette

### Primary Colors
- **Background**: Pure white (#FFFFFF)
- **Text**: Dark charcoal/near black (#333333 or #2C2C2C)
- **Accent**: Minimal use of color, primarily relying on typography contrast

### Image Accents
- Botanical illustrations featuring warm, natural tones
- Warm fruits/florals with green foliage
- Muted, watercolor-style rendering

## Navigation Design

### Structure
- Horizontal navigation bar
- Evenly spaced items
- Clean separation between items

### Styling
- All caps text
- Serif font
- No underlines on hover (clean, minimal approach)
- Subtle hover states

## Content Formatting

### Information Display
- Clear organizational structure
- Metadata prominently displayed
- Content in paragraph format
- Italics used sparingly for emphasis
- Consistent indentation and spacing

### Information Architecture
- Logical content hierarchy
- Easy scanning with clear section breaks
- Clean integration of supporting information

## Visual Elements

### Illustrations
- Botanical watercolor-style illustrations
- Positioned as decorative accents, not overwhelming the content
- Natural, organic feeling artwork
- Framed or bordered presentation

### Borders & Lines
- Minimal use of decorative elements
- Clean, simple borders around illustrations
- No heavy rules or dividers in text areas

## Responsive Considerations
- Design should maintain elegance across devices
- Typography hierarchy must remain clear on smaller screens
- Navigation should collapse appropriately for mobile
- Generous whitespace should be preserved but adjusted for screen size

## Technical Implementation Notes

### CSS Considerations
- Use web fonts that closely match the script style for headings
- Implement proper fallback fonts for the serif body text
- Ensure adequate contrast ratios for accessibility
- Use CSS Grid or Flexbox for clean, centered layouts

### Performance
- Optimize illustrations for web delivery
- Consider SVG format for scalable graphics
- Implement proper font loading strategies

## Accessibility Requirements
- Maintain strong color contrast ratios
- Ensure navigation is keyboard accessible
- Provide proper heading hierarchy for screen readers
- Use semantic HTML structure throughout

This style guide captures a refined, content-focused approach that prioritizes readability and elegant simplicity over visual complexity.
